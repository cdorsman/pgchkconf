# pgchkconf
Check tool for postgresql.conf made in C

**Why pgchkconf?**
At this moment PostgreSQL doesn't have any tool checking syntax of postgresql.conf file.
It only checks at reloading and restarting. What makes the process quite tidious.

So that's where pgchkconf comes in. It does thurough check on syntax and on the values per statement.

**What options does pgchkconf have?**
Just give the location of postgresql.conf. That will be enough.
